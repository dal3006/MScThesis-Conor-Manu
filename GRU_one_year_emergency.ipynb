Tensors are represented as n-dimensional arrays of base dataypes such as a string or integer -- they provide a way to generalize vectors and matrices to higher dimensions. The shape of a Tensor defines its number of dimensions and the size of each dimension. The rank of a Tensor provides the number of dimensions. Scalars can be used to create 0-d Tensors.
